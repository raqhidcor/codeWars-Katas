// In her trip to Italy, Elizabeth Gilbert made it her duty to eat perfect pizza. One day she ordered one for dinner, and then some Italian friends appeared at her room. 
// The problem is that there were many people who ask for a piece of pizza at that moment, and she had a knife that only cuts straight.

// Given the number of pizza cuts, find the maximum amount of pieces of pizza that you can get (not necessarily of equal size). 
// If the number of cuts is negative, return -1 instead (or Nothing in Haskell).

function maxPizza(cuts) {
    if (cuts < 0){
      return -1
    } else if (cuts == 0) {
      return 1
      }
    return (cuts*(cuts+1)/2)+1
  }

//   You have passed all of the tests! :)
